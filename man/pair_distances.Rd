\title{Similarity and distance computation between documents or features}
\usage{
pair_distances(dat, Z, form = c("data.frame", "list"),
  include = c("cosine", "euclidean", "mahalanobis", "propensity"),
  propensity.method = c("glm", "mnir"), exclude = "jaccard",
  docnames = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A logical or binary vector indicating treatment and control for each unit in the study.
TRUE or 1 represents a treatment unit, FALSE of 0 represents a control unit.}

\item{form}{Should the distances be returned as a list of matrices or condensed into a single data frame?}

\item{propensity.method}{Either GLM or MNIR for propensity score estimation}

\item{docnames}{A vector of document names equal in length to the number of documents}

\item{x}{a matrix text representation with rows corresponding to each document in a corpus and columns
that represent summary measures of the text (e.g., word counts, topic proportions, etc.). Acceptable forms include
a valid \pkg{quanteda} \code{dfm} object, a \pkg{tm} Document-Term Matrix, or a matrix of estimated topic proportions.}
}
\value{
A matrix showing pairwise distances for all potential matches of treatment and control units under various distance metrics
}
\description{
These functions compute distance matrices from a text representation where each row is a document
and each column is a feature to measure distance over based on treatment indicator Z
}
